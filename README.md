# Kotlin-Native
Code base which shows the usage of Kotlin native framework to develop applications for both Android and IOS using Kotlin language

### Why Kotlin/Native?

Kotlin/Native is primarily designed to allow compilation for platforms where virtual machines are not desirable or possible, for example, embedded devices or iOS. It solves the situations when a developer needs to produce a self-contained program that does not require an additional runtime or virtual machine.

 ### Target Platforms
 
Kotlin/Native supports the following platforms:

iOS (arm32, arm64, simulator x86_64)
MacOS (x86_64)
Android (arm32, arm64)
Windows (mingw x86_64, x86)
Linux (x86_64, arm32, MIPS, MIPS little endian, Raspberry Pi)
WebAssembly (wasm32)
